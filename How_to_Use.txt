How to Use Convert-CSV-into-VCF Converter (convert_csv.py)
----------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ Update the csv file with correct information


2️⃣ Ensure Python Is Installed

	Open a terminal (or PowerShell / Command Prompt) and type:
    			python --version

	If not, download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it.
	(During installation, check the box that says “Add Python to PATH.”)


3️⃣ Navigate to the Folder

	In Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   			cd "path\to\Convert-CSV-into-VCF"


4️⃣ Run the Script

	python convert_csv.py


5️⃣ Check the Output

	After running, you should see a new file:
    			contacts.vcf

That’s your vCard file. You can open it with any text editor to verify, or import it into:
	- Android Contacts
	- iPhone Contacts (via iCloud import)
	- Outlook / Thunderbird, etc.


6️⃣ Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
| python: command not found | Python not installed or PATH not set | Reinstall Python and enable “Add to PATH” |
| ModuleNotFoundError | Missing library | Run pip install pandas (or what the error says) |
| FileNotFoundError | Wrong file name or path | Ensure contacts.csv is in same folder or use full path |
